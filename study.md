## Study these (From Milan)
I recently came across the following excellent (IMO) collection of MIT lectures called "The Missing Semester of your CS Education". Strongly recommended for all developers and IT group regardless of your "seniority" level:
https://missing.csail.mit.edu/2020/
Their GitHub home is (consider staring them):
https://github.com/missing-semester/missing-semester
If you watch nothing else please do watch the lecture on git
