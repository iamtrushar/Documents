## Guidlines
Basic development and contribution guidelines can be found here:
https://github.com/pandell/SamplePliWeb/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md

Please note that they are located in `(project-root)/.github` directory. This is a special directory that is recognized by GitHub, making guideline links appear when e.g. creating a pull request. For more information see:
https://help.github.com/articles/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors/

Each project is also expected to have a `(project-root)/README.md` (Markdown format) that briefly summarizes purpose of the project, setup and build steps, etc.

Example:

Example with TeamCity build status:
